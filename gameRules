Welcome to Blackjack!

The goal of this game is to get a higher hand than the dealer.
If you go over 21, you lose!

• face cards count as 10
• numbered cards count as their indicated value (ex. 3 is worth 3)
• You can "hit" to draw another card
• You can "stand" to keep your current hand
• There are 5 decks of cards shuffled into the main stack.


After the user draws their cards, the dealer will then draw theirs.

It's important to know that the dealer will not draw cards if their
hand value is greater than 17.

Good luck! Have fun!
